| Start with the motor. Put the shaft in the slot like in the picture. The wires need to be *away* from the motor mount. | ![](../motor-1.jpg) |
| Turn the motor until the yellow plastic tab is in the slot in the end of the motor mount, and push the motor against this end wall. | ![](../motor-2.jpg) |
| There is a small yellow circle on the side of the motor. This needs to be pushed into the matching hole on the motor mount. | ![](../motor-4.jpg) |
| The motor should fit flat, like in this picture. | ![](../motor-5.jpg) |
| Now put the switch through the hole in the top of the motor mount. | ![](../pcb-1.jpg) ![](../pcb-2.jpg) |
| The circuit board should snap into the motor mount and sit square. | ![](../pcb-3.jpg) |
| The hole is wide to let the switch in easily, but it needs to be pushed to the middle of the motor mount to work well. | ![](../switch-1.jpg) ![](../switch-2.jpg) |
| Now put the arm on the motor. | ![](../arm-1.jpg) ![](../arm-2.jpg) ![](../arm-3.jpg) |
| You can test everything now by putting in batteries. Be careful not to pinch your fingers! | ![](../batteries.jpg) |
| If the arm doesn't move, check that your terminal block connections are tight. If it moves the wrong way, you need to switch the motor wires. | ![](../test-1.jpg) |
| When everything is working, connect the top to the motor mount with one of the nuts from the switch. | ![](../top-1.jpg) |
| Test the switch again, then fit the top into the box. | ![](../top-2.jpg) |
| Now put the battery holder in the battery holder holder. | ![](../bhh-1.jpg) |
| Finally, put on the lid. | ![](../lid-1.jpg) |
| Congratulations! | ![](../done.jpg) |
