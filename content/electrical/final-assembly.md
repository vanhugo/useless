| Start with the motor. Put the shaft in the slot like in the picture. The wires need to be *away* from the motor mount. | ![](../motor-1.jpg) |
| Turn the motor until the yellow plastic tab is in the slot in the end of the motor mount, and push the motor against this end wall. | ![](../motor-2.jpg) |
| There is a small yellow circle on the side of the motor. This needs to be pushed into the matching hole on the motor mount. | ![](../motor-4.jpg) |
| The motor should fit flat, like in this picture. | ![](../motor-5.jpg) |
| Now put the switch through the hole in the top of the motor mount. | ![](../pcb-1.jpg) ![](../pcb-2.jpg) |
| The circuit board should snap into the motor mount and sit square. | ![](../pcb-3.jpg) |

(more to come... very soon...)
