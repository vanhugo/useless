| Look at the bottom of the circuit board, under the blue terminal blocks.<br><br>One side is labeled for the batteries, the other for the motor. Also there are markings above for red and below for black wires.<br><br>The batteries are connected as labeled, but there is one trick for connecting the motor, explained next. | ![](../circuit-markings.jpg) |
| Before wiring the motor, look at your motor mount.<br><br>This picture shows the 'normal' way to build the mount, after the motor is installed. (Don't install the motor yet, just compare your mount to the picture.) | ![](../mm-preview.jpg) |
| This picture shows the 'flipped' way to build the motor mount. Either will work, but if you built a 'flipped' motor mount, you'll need to connect the motor wires backwards; red to black and black to red. Only flip the motor wires, not the battery wires. | ![](../mm-preview-flip.jpg) |
| Now put the wires in the terminal blocks and screw them in. | ![](../terminals-1.jpg) ![](../terminals-2.jpg) |

Once this is done, wait for your glue to dry and [put everything together](../final-assembly/).
