| First set out the box pieces like this.<br><br> Donâ€™t include the top piece with the hole in it. The kit is easiest to assemble and maintain if this top piece is never glued in. | ![Box before glue](../box-before-glue.jpg) |
| Make sure the sides you want on the inside are facing up.<br><br> Now put glue on the cracks. | ![Box with glue](../box-with-glue-1.jpg) |
| Put glue on all the joint fingers *except* the six for the box top. | ![](../box-with-glue-2.jpg) |
| Now fold up the sides. | ![](../box-fold-1.jpg) |
| Squeeze the parts together tightly! | ![](../box-fold-2.jpg) |
| Set the box aside to dry. | ![](../box-fold-3.jpg) |
| Do the same thing with the lid. | ![](../lid-glue.jpg) ![](../lid-fold.jpg) |
| Now glue the motor mounts together. | ![](../mm-glue-1.jpg) ![](../mm-glue-2.jpg) ![](../mm-glue-3.jpg) |
| Again, make sure the parts are squeezed together tightly. | ![](../mm-glue-4.jpg) |
| When the box is dry, glue the first piece of the battery holder holder. | ![](../bhh-glue-1.jpg) |
| Make sure to put the battery holder holder in the shorter lid-end of the box. | ![](../bhh-glue-2.jpg) |
| Next, glue the thin hinge pieces in. | ![](../hinge-glue-1.jpg) |
| They should fit into the corners with the battery holder holder. | ![](../hinge-glue-2.jpg) |
| Now put the other part of the battery holder holder in. | ![](../bhh-glue-3.jpg) ![](../bhh-glue-4.jpg) |
| Finally, glue the top hinge piece in the lid. | ![](../hinge-glue-3.jpg) ![](../hinge-glue-4.jpg) |

The gluing is done! Let everything dry and start [assembling the electrical parts](../../electrical/).
