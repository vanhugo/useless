| The first thing you should do is unpack and organize the bag of wooden parts. | ![Wood kit parts](../wood-parts.jpg) |
| Notice that there is a burned side and a clean side to each part. You can choose what side you want to be the outside of the box. | ![Wood sides](../wood-sides.jpg) |
| Now separate your parts into groups: ||
| Box  | ![Wood box](../wood-box.jpg) |
| Lid  | ![Wood lid](../wood-lid.jpg) |
| Motor mount | ![Wood motor mount](../wood-motor-mount.jpg) |
| Battery holder holder | ![Wood battery holder](../wood-bhh.jpg) |
| Hinge | ![Wood hinge](../wood-hinge.jpg) |

Now it is time to [assemble these parts](../../box-build/).
