### Chapter 1

---

If you're reading this, you probably bought a useless machine kit from me at
VMMF 2017.

*Thank you!*

This site explains how to assemble your new kit.
Please read everything before you start putting it together.
Assembly will be easier that way.
You should be able to build the kit in about an hour.

#### Things you'll need

* The kit (of course)
* A small slot screwdriver
* Wood glue
* 2 AA batteries
